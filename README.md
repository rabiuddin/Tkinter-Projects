# 🛠️ Tkinter Projects

A collection of various graphical user interface (GUI) applications developed using Python's standard GUI library, **Tkinter**. This repository serves as a showcase of my skills in creating interactive, desktop-based tools.

## 🚀 Projects Included

This repository contains the source code for the following Tkinter applications:

| Project Name | Description | Key Features | Status |

## ✨ General Features

All projects in this repository leverage the following core aspects of Tkinter:

* **Platform Independent:** Works seamlessly across Windows, macOS, and Linux.
* **Intuitive UI:** Designed for ease of use.
* **Custom Widgets:** Utilizes standard Tkinter widgets (Buttons, Labels, Entry, Text, etc.) and sometimes custom widgets (using `ttk`).

## ⚙️ Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

You need **Python 3.x** installed on your system. Tkinter is typically included with standard Python distributions, so no extra installation is usually required.

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/rabiuddin/Tkinter-Projects.git](https://github.com/rabiuddin/Tkinter-Projects.git)
    ```
2.  **Navigate to the project directory:**
    ```bash
    cd Tkinter-Projects
    ```

### Running a Project

Each project is contained within its own file. To run any specific application, navigate into its file and execute the Python file.
